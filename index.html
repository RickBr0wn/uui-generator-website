          <h2>What is a universally unique identification number?</h2>
          <hr />
          <p>
            A UUID (Universal Unique Identifier) is a 128-bit number used to
            uniquely identify some object or entity on the Internet. Depending
            on the specific mechanisms used, a UUID is either guaranteed to be
            different or is, at least, extremely likely to be different from any
            other UUID generated until 3400 A.D. <br />In its authoritative
            textual representation, the 16 octets of a UUID are represented as
            32 hexadecimal (base-16) digits, displayed in 5 groups separated by
            hyphens, in the form 8-4-4-4-12 for a total of 36 characters (32
            alphanumeric characters and 4 hyphens).<br />
            <br />For example:
            <span class="code">123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000</span>
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="item">
          <h2>So why are UUID's so important in React?</h2>
          <hr />
          <p>
            React's power lies in its robust reconciliation process. When we use
            JSX to create or update components, React creates its own virtual
            DOM. It compares this virtual DOM to the actual DOM in the browser,
            calculating the least number of changes necessary to update the
            actual DOM to match the virtual DOM. <br />Sometimes we use multiple
            instances of the same component in the same spot. Such as the
            multiple instances of a 'TodoItem' component inside a 'TodoList'
            component. When this occurs, unique keys are very important, because
            they allow React to differentiate between these similar components,
            and hone in on any that may need to be updated individually, instead
            of re-rendering them all.

            This is a packaged as an NPM library, and can be seen at
            <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-uuid" target="_blank"
              >https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-uuid</a
            >. <br />To install simply type
            <span class="code">npm i react-uuid</span> at the command line, at
            the root of your project. It can be then easily used. For example:
          </p>
          <br />
          <pre class="code">

            import React from 'react'
            import uuid from 'react-uuid'

            const array = ['one', 'two', 'three']

            export const LineItem = item => &lt;li key={uuid()}&gt;{item}&lt;/li&gt;

            export const List = () => array.map(item => &lt;LineItem item={item} /&gt;)
          </pre>
          <br />
          <p>
            In the above example, the output would be 3
            <span class="code">LineItem</span> components being rendered, with
            each <span class="code">LineItem</span> supplied a universal unique
            identifier, which when required, will allow React to identify which
            <span class="code">LineItem</span> component should be mutated.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="item wide">
          <h2>
            Before you go, Why is there an asterix next to the word random, in
            the title?

          <p>
            Well, <span class="code">react-uuid</span> uses the Javascript
            <span class="code">Math.random()</span> function, which can be seen
            here
            <a
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random"
              target="_blank"
              >https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random</a
            >. But, surprise surprise,
            <span class="code">Math.random()</span> doesn’t really generate a
            random number. Not exactly. It just does a really good job of
            simulating randomness. Algorithmic random number generation can’t
            exactly be random, per se; which is why they’re more aptly called
            pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs). If you’re using math and
            formulae to create a sequence of numbers, random though they might
            seem, those numbers will eventually repeat and reveal a non-random
            pattern.
            <a
              href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator"
              target="_blank"
              >https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator</a
            >. But for the usage in this package, pseudo-random is more than
            sufficient.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I genuinely hope you find this package useful, I've really enjoyed
            building it. Any suggestions, comments or bugs, please open a pull
            request, and I'll respond as soon as I can. Happy coding!
